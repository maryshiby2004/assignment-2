        <p class="sad">Everybody go</p>
        <p class="happy">The party's over</p>
        <p class="happy">I want to be alone in my head</p>
        <p class="happy">In my bed tonight</p>
        <p class="happy">You never show</p>
        <p class="happy">You must really love her</p>
        <p class="happy">You think I don't know</p>
        <p class="happy">But I do, yeah it's true</p>
        <p class="happy">I think over is over</p>
        <p class="happy">I'm right back where I started</p>
        <p class="happy">(when it comes to wanting you)</p>
        <p class="happy">I can't have what I wanted</p>
        <p class="happy">But I did, I can</p>
        <p class="happy">I was, I am</p>
        <p class="happy">Only human, living, dying</p>
        <p class="happy">Just like any fool who ever breathed</p>
        <p class="happy">If love is blind</p>
        <p class="happy">If love's a drug</p>
        <p class="happy">It always is</p>
        <p class="happy">It always was and</p>
        <p class="happy">Love was surely made for fools like me</p>
